Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

  My name is Kristina Therese Panlilio but since my first name is too long, I usually go by Kate. Let me briefly share my first experience with coding and how it shaped who I am today!
  
  When I was 13 years old, I was fascinated by the idea of making things happen by typing a few commands on my screen. The moment I successfully printed out "Hello World!" in Pascal made me curious to learn more. This started with my first CS class in middle school. This teacher had a unique approach to teaching the class by incorporating a competitive element into in-class coding exercises. He gave us general prompts to work with, but it was a race against time. The first ten students who succeeded got a perfect score and extra credit for that assignment. This motivated me to keep aiming for that top spot. The best part of that experience was that once ten people were done, they could assist other students who didn't get it in time. This learning experience really sparked my enjoyment for coding and especially problem-solving together with fellow coders. 

  Throughout my years of learning, in high school, I started learning and applying some of the basics of web-based languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned the basics of Python and Java. Currently, the classes I'm taking at my university are refining my knowledge and proficiency in object-oriented programming languages like Java, and C++, and even low-level programming languages like C. I look forward to further improving my skills and abilities from these classes and from my peers as well. Being skilled in a variety of programming languages is one of the components to achieving my end goal of being a flexible and versatile computer scientist in the future! Or maybe even achieve my dream career to be a game developer!
  
  For now, I will continue to work hard and do my best in my classes! Maybe play video games or browse the latest developments in tech during my free time...
